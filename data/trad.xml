                  vineyards and fields, then one finds a great and beautiful city which is called

                  cities and boroughs, with much trade and industry, vineyards and fields. And from
                  here the wine is carried into the province of <placeName>Cathay</placeName>,
                  because wine is not produced there. And there are also many <term>mulberry

                  number of cities, which are not very far from one another: they are highly
                  frequented because of the many merchandises which are continually carried from one
                  city to the other; and in each of them fairs are held.</seg>

                  the <term>hunting preserves</term> of the Lord. Here no one dares go hunting

                  family, and those who are in the roll of the Captain of the Falconers; but, beyond
                  this limit everyone may go <term>hunting</term>, on condition that he is a

                  however hardly ever went <term>hunting</term> in those

                  extent, and especially the <term>hares</term>, that they destroyed the crops of
